Efficient code execution throughput prediction using LSTM-based machine-learning
Machine learning and neural networks have made great progress in recent years. Although scientists have made multiple studies in this field, the last few years have evolved. The main reason is the rise of the available data and computer resources. The science of machine learning uses its results in computer vision, medicine and other fields of data analysis. In this thesis, a  neural-network-based model is used to predict throughput of different basic blocks. This throughput estimation problem is a basic field of work for both researchers and programmers. 
First of all, the basic model of this thesis, ithemal, is presented and there are given details for traditional models that were used all the previous years. Afterwards, there are analyzed aspects of neural networks, not only the commonly used networks but also those of ithemal. A modern neural network, called Transformer, is presented as an alternative version to predict the throughput of basic blocks. The dataset that was used to train and evaluate each model is the next issue analyzed. Finally, the main model is presented with the experiments made to evaluate the extracted results. Concluding, we summarize the research findings and propose future studies.
